= XTDB 2.x Documentation

We use https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[Antora] to build the XTDB documentation.

This documentation is deployed to https://core2docs.xtdb.com/[core2docs.xtdb.com].
You can also build the documentation yourself with the following instructions.

== Install:

* Requires Node/NPM installed.

== Build:

* `./bin/build.sh`
** Troubleshooting: `npm install`

== View:

* `./bin/open-local-site.sh` to open up the built version of the site in your browser.
* `./bin/run-local-server.sh` to open the site if you require plugins (like Dark Reader) which work poorly with `file://` URLs.

== Deploy:

* `./bin/deploy.sh`
