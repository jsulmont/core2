= `psql` (pgwire)

== Install

Install `psql` (Postgres) if you don't have it already.
Some package managers offer the Postgres client in isolation
(ubuntu has `postgresql-client`) but this is surprisingly uncommon.

[source,sh]
----
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql
sudo pacman -S postgresql
brew install postgresql
# etc.
----

== Connect

[source,sh]
----
psql -h localhost
----

Press `CTRL+D` to quit.

== Troubleshooting: Docker Desktop

You should see a prompt ending in `=&gt;`.
If you see `=#`, you are running a (regular) PostgreSQL server on port 5432.
The XTDB Docker image will not collide with the regular PostgreSQL service because of
https://www.docker.com/blog/how-docker-desktop-networking-works-under-the-hood/[the funky way Docker Desktop's networking works].
To connect to XTDB, stop your regular PostgreSQL instance, then reconnect to XTDB.
(You don't need to restart the XTDB Docker container.)
