= Postgres Wire Protocol Overview

XTDB 2.x permits connections over the
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/protocol.html[Postgres Wire Protocol, v3] ("pgwire").

The Postgres SQL _dialect_, however, is not supported. See the notes below.

== Semantics

=== Schemaless

XTDB is schemaless.
For now, it is not possible to inspect the schema of XTDB tables using a tool like https://www.quest.com/toad/[Toad].
In the future, XTDB may support discoverable schemas, even without up-front table definitions.

=== XTDB SQL Dialect

XTDB supports real SQL.
Where possible, the XTDB SQL dialect conforms to the
https://www.iso.org/standard/53681.html[ISO SQL:2011] specification.
Some features of the https://www.iso.org/standard/63555.html[SQL:2016] specification have also been adopted.

Although XTDB permits connections through the Postgres Wire Protocol,
it does _not_ support the Postgres SQL dialect.

=== Return Values

All values returned from an XTDB SQL query over the Postgres Wire Protocol are encoded as JSON.
Since XTDB is schemaless and supports nested data, JSON is natural:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO people (id, name, friends)
  VALUES (5678, 'Sarah',
          [{'user': 'Dan'},
           {'user': 'Kath'}]);

SELECT people.friends[2] from people;
----

However, it may be initially surprising to find that even scalar values are returned as JSON:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO posts (id, user_id, text, updated_at)
  VALUES (1234, 5678, 'Hello World!', TIMESTAMP '2022-08-14 12:30:59');

-- over pgwire, this returns "2022-08-14T12:30:59"
select posts.updated_at from posts;

-- more surprisingly, 'posts.text' is a JSON string, not a SQL string
SELECT posts.text from posts;
----
