= XTDB 'core2' Research ðŸ§ª

Welcome to the XTDB research repository!

core2 is a bitemporal and dynamic relational database for SQL and Datalog:

- Bitemporal means that all data is accurately versioned as updates are made (system time), and all data exists within a universal domain timeline for representing 'validity'/'effectivity' (application time).
- Dynamic means that no upfront schema needs to be specified before records can be inserted. Complex and nested data is automatically represented using https://arrow.apache.org/[Apache Arrow] types.
- Relational means that the full spectrum of traditional SQL database capabilities is available - including joins, transactions, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset#Applications[bag/multiset] semantics, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic[three-valued logic], multiple N-ary relations etc.
- SQL means immediate accessibility for a mainstream audience, but also includes an eye to the future with preliminary https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/02/16/introducing-arrow-flight-sql/[Flight SQL] driver support.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog[Datalog] means a programmer-friendly API for complex relational querying that bypasses SQL's verbose JOINs and https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/against-sql/[compositional challenges].

core2 can currently be used via Clojure, Java, and HTTP.

== Warning

This is experimental, pre-alpha software.

If you are looking for a stable release of an immutable document database with bitemporal query capabilities, we are continuing to develop and support XTDB 1.x at https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb.

== Inside-out Architecture

XTDB embraces the transaction log as the central point of coordination when running as a distributed system.

[quote,Martin Kleppman]
____
What do we have to gain from turning the database inside out?

Simpler code, better scalability, better robustness, lower latency, and more flexibility for doing interesting things with data.

== How does this differ from XTDB 1.x?

XTDB 1.x is a mature product offering that is used in production by many organizations, and its ongoing development is focused on hardening and performance.
XTDB 1.x is an embeddable database that emphasizes in-process JVM usage to enable advanced functionality like user-defined transaction functions, speculative transactions, programmatic Datalog rules, and more.

core2's initial objective is to take the key principles embodied in XTDB 1.x -- immutability, schemaless records, and temporal querying -- to a mainstream audience.

See link:DATALOG.adoc[] for instructions on how to translate 1.x Datalog transactions/queries to core2.

== Repo Layout

core2 is split across multiple projects which are maintained within this repository.

* `api` contains the user API to core2.
* `core` contains the main functional components of XTDB along with interfaces for the pluggable storage components (Kafka, JDBC, S3 DB etc.).
  Implementations of these storage options are located in their own projects.
* `http-server` and `http-client-clj` contain the HTTP server implementation, and a remote client for Clojure users.
* Storage and other modules are under `modules`.
  Modules are published to Maven independently so that you can maintain granular dependencies on precisely the individual components needed for your application.

== Pre-Release Snapshot Builds

Maven snapshot versions are periodically published under `dev-SNAPSHOT` and are used to facilitate support and debugging activities during the development cycle.
To access snapshots versions, the Sonatype snapshot repository must be added to your project definition:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
  <id>sonatype.snapshots</id>
  <name>Sonatype Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
  <releases>
    <enabled>false</enabled>
  </releases>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </snapshots>
</repository>
----

[source,clojure]
----
;; project.clj
:repositories [["sonatype-snapshots" {:url "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"}]]
----

[source,clojure]
----
;; deps.edn
:mvn/repos {"sonatype-snapshots" {:url "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"}}
----

In contrast to regular releases which are immutable, a `dev-SNAPSHOT` release can be "updated" - this mutability can often be useful but may also cause unexpected surprises when depending on `dev-SNAPSHOT` for longer than necessary.
Snapshot versions, including full `dev-<timestamp>` coordinates (which are useful to avoid being caught out by mutation), can be found https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/xtdb/xtdb-core/dev-SNAPSHOT/[here].

=== Troubleshooting

Certain older versions of Docker (< 20.10.10) struggle with newer Linux images.
When that happens, you will see this error:

[source,sh]
----
# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
# Cannot create worker GC thread. Out of system resources.
----

To resolve this, upgrade to the latest version of Docker.
