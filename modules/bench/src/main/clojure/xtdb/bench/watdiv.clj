  ;; run in XTDB 1.x's xtdb.bench.watdiv-xtdb.

  ;; had to temporarily replace a few calls to `keyword` within xtdb-rdf with just `str` too -
  ;; core2 doesn't like URLs as keywords (well, XTDB 1.x shouldn't either, but that's another story.)

  ;; (JH, 2022-03-18) this ^^ might be better since I re-did a lot of XTDB 1.x's WatDiv bench recently
